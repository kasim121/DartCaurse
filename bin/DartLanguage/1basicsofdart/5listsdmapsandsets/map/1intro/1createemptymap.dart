Map Data Structure:
A Map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value.
It is also known as an associative array, dictionary, or hash table in other programming languages.
Maps are unordered collections, meaning the order of elements is not guaranteed.
Each key in a map must be unique, but the values can be duplicated.
Keys and values can be of any data type, including primitive types, collections, or custom objects.
*/

/*
Key Features of Maps:
Efficient lookup: Maps provide fast access to values based on their keys.
Dynamic size: Maps can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.
Flexibility: Maps allow various types of keys and values, providing flexibility in data representation.
Iterable: Maps can be iterated over to access their key-value pairs.
Commonly used for modeling relationships: Maps are commonly used to model relationships between entities, such as user profiles, settings, or configurations.
