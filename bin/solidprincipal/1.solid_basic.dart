| Principle              | Description                                                                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single Responsibility** | A class should have only one reason to change.                                                   |
| **Open-Closed**           | Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.                               |
| **Liskov Substitution**   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. |
| **Interface Segregation** | Avoid forcing classes to implement methods they don’t use; split large interfaces into smaller ones. |
| **Dependency Inversion**  | Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations; use dependency injection.                  |


S — Single responsibility principle.
O — Open closed principle.
